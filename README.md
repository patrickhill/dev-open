# Open Folder Script

## Purpose
Applescripts open active folder from Finder or Path Finder in Terminal and Sublime Text 2

## Dependencies
* For best use, you'll need to use [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/) or  another app that can set keyboard shortcuts to run Applescripts.
* This is currently set up to work with Sublime Text 2 but you can easily swap out your version by changing the 'application file id' in the script to match your version.

## Directions for Usage with Quicksilver
### Set Up Trigger
1. Download these scripts and put them in a safe place so you don't delete them
2. Open Quicksilver preferences
3. Click 'Triggers' tab in the top menu
4. Click the '+' at the bottom of the screen to add new trigger
5. Select 'Keyboard' from dropdown
6. Search for scripts by typing the file name or drag the script into 'Select an item'
7. Under 'Action' type 'Run'
8. Click 'Save' button

### Asign Keyboard Shortcut
1. After creating the trigger, a window will slide out. If you don't see this, click 'None' in the trigger column next to your newely created trigger.
2. Click 'edit' in the shortcut area
3. Type the key command you'd like to use. Example: cmd+opt+o
4. Contratulations, you're all set! Now you can select a file in your file browser of choice and open it Terminal or Sublime Text 2
